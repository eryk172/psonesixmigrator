# PrestaShop to thirty bees Migrator

Our Prestashop to thirty bees migrator module allows you to migrate any 1.6 version of PrestaShop to thirty bees.

## Description

The thirty bees migrator module allows you to migrate any version of PrestaShop 1.6 to thirty bees quickly and easily. The module installs like a normal PrestaShop module and converts your existing shop over to thirty bees, making all the changes needed and applying the over 2000 bug fixes and speed optimizations to your shop.

**This module is not to be used with PrestaShop version 1.4 or 1.5.** For updating these versions, update to PrestaShop 1.6.1.x using the PrestaShop updater, first.

## Contributing

thirty bees modules are Open Source extensions to the thirty bees e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements.

For details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/thirtybees/thirtybees/blob/1.0.x/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the thirty bees core repository.

## Packaging

To build a package for the thirty bees distribution machinery or suitable for importing it into a shop, run `tools/buildmodule.sh` of the thirty bees core repository from inside the module root directory.

For module development, one clones this repository into `modules/` of the shop, alongside the other modules. It should work fine without packaging.
