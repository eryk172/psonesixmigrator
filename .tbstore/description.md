The thirty bees migrator module allows you to migrate any version of PrestaShop 1.6 to thirty bees quickly and easily. The module installs like a normal PrestaShop module and converts your existing shop over to thirty bees, making all the changes needed and applying the over 2000 bug fixes and speed optimizations to your shop.

**This module is not to be used with PrestaShop version 1.4 or 1.5.** For updating these versions, update to PrestaShop 1.6.1.x using the PrestaShop updater, first.
